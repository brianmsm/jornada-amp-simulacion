  abstract = {Monte Carlo simulation is one of the most important tools in all fields of science. Monte Carlo methods use samples of numbers that appear to be random, although the numbers are generated by deterministic computer algorithms. These ``pseudorandom'' samples can be used in solving a wide range of problems, including both deterministic problems such as evaluating a definite integral and problems in which there is a random component such as studying and comparing the performance of statistical procedures under various assumptions about the underlying distribution.},
